; MSX1 16 KiB cartridge ROM
; Shared LDIR subroutine (COPY) called with a DIFFERENT BC from three
; call sites (5, then 3, then 4).
;   DI (no IRQ interruption) for determinism: each run is exactly the
; requested number of iterations, back to back with only CALL/RET/LD
; overhead between runs.
; Exercises step_back's handling of one block-repeat PC executed several
; times with different initial counters: rewinding the last execution
; must land on ITS first iteration (BC=4), not on an earlier
; higher-count execution.
