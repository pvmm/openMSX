MSXPi Quick Start
=================

MSXPi is a hardware and software solution that allows MSX 
computers to control and use Raspberry Pi resources. The interface
exposes I/O ports for the MSX computer, which allows exchange of 
data with the Raspberry Pi using a custom protocol. Many resources are
implemented, such as access to network drives, internet, disk images,
and access to the Raspberry Pi itself to execute commands.

The MSXPiDevice for openMSX implements the same functionality of the
physical MSXPi without the need of a Raspberry Pi - instead, relies 
on a Python msxpi-server code running on the same coomputer where 
openMSX is hosted.

You can try the extension following steps below. Bear in mind that
the server-side component "msxpi-server.py" was developed and
extensively tested on the physical MSXPi with a real Raspberry Pi.
At this time, may commands will not work properly on the openMSX
due to platform differences when running the server, but these will
be ported as time allows and other developers step in to contribute.

Once you have openMSX with the MSXPi already compiled in the code:

1. Download the MSXPi server "msxpi-server.py" from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/Server/Python/src/
   
   and copy to any folder where you can have access from a command line.
   
   
2. Start msxpi-server.py - the server can be started before or after
   openMSX, that does not matter.
   
   python3 mspxi-server.py
   
   
3. Download "msxpibios.rom" (BIOS with BASIC CALL commands) from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/target/
   
  and copy to your \openMSX\share\systemroms\extensions\
  

4. Download "MSXPi.xml" from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/openMSX/share/extensions/
   
   and copy to your \openMSX\share\extensions\

5. Create a folder named "diska" (will be used later as Drive A: in openMSX).
   You must copy the MSX-DOS files to this folder:
      MSXDOS.SYS
	  COMMAND.COM

6. Download the MSXPi commands you want to test from:
   https://github.com/costarc/MSXPi/tree/master/software/target/
   
   Suggestion to start with:
    - chatgpt.com (but you need an OpenAI key to use it)
    - prun.com
	- pcd.com
	- pdir.com
	- BASIC/weather.bas
	- BASIC/irc.bas
	
   and copy them to "diska" folder.

7. Start openMSX loading the MSXPi extension. I am using the FS-A1WSX but
   you can use your favorite MSX instead:

   openmsx -machine Panasonic_FS-A1WSX -ext MSXPi -diska diska
